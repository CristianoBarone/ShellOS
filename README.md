# ShellOS
ShellOS is a minimal operating system made for tinkering.

It is currently being worked on, always consider that the code may change at any time.
Contribution is appreciated!

The system works on x86_64 machines, it is specifically targeted for 64 bits usage.

Currently:
  - Implementing a FAT32 filesystem library
  - Implementing an ELF loader
